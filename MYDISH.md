my favorite dish is butter chicken, or "murgh makhani." It's a rich, creamy curry made 
with tender pieces of chicken cooked in a velvety tomato-based sauce, flavored with a blend of spices like garam masala,
cumin, and fenugreek. What I love most about butter chicken is how it balances bold flavors with a smooth, comforting texture.
